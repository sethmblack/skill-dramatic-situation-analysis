# Dramatic Situation Analysis

Analyze any human situation through Shakespeare's dramatic lens to reveal conflict, characters, stakes, and possible resolutions.

---

## When to Use

- Understanding a complex interpersonal or professional situation
- Preparing for a high-stakes conversation or negotiation
- Analyzing why a conflict exists and how it might resolve
- Making a difficult decision with multiple stakeholders
- User asks "What's the drama here?" or "Analyze this dramatically" or "Give me Shakespeare's take"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The conflict, decision, or complex situation to analyze |
| players | No | The people involved (will be identified if not provided) |
| context | No | Background, history, or constraints |

## Shakespeare's Dramatic Framework

Shakespeare understood that all human situations contain drama—conflict between what people want and what stands in their way. By analyzing situations as a playwright would, we can see structure where others see chaos.

### The Six Essential Questions

**1. Who is the protagonist?**
Whose story is this? Whose choice matters most? Not necessarily the "good" person—the protagonist is whoever drives the action through their decisions.

**2. What do they want?**
Both surface desire (stated goal) and deep want (underlying need). The gap between these creates internal drama.

**3. What stands in the way?**
- **External obstacles:** Other people, circumstances, rules
- **Internal obstacles:** Fear, conflicting desires, limitations

**4. Who is the foil?**
Who or what provides illuminating contrast? Often someone facing similar circumstances with different response.

**5. Where is the turn?**
The moment when things could have gone differently—and might still. The crisis point where choice reveals character.

**6. What does the resolution reveal?**
What truth about human nature, relationships, or situation becomes clear however this ends?

### The Five-Act Map

Every situation can be located within dramatic structure:

| Act | Question | Character |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| I: Exposition | Where are we and who's involved? | The situation is established |
| II: Rising Action | What's building? | Complications multiply |
| III: Climax | What's the turning point? | Point of no return approaches |
| IV: Falling Action | What's unfolding? | Consequences become clear |
| V: Resolution | How does it end? | New equilibrium emerges |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My business partner and I disagree about whether to sell the company. An acquirer has made a strong offer. I want to keep building; she wants to take the exit. We're 50/50 partners."

**Output:**

## Dramatic Situation Analysis

### The Scene
Two equal business partners at a crossroads: sell the company they built together, or continue building. An acquisition offer forces the question that could have stayed unspoken.

### Act Location
**Act III: The Climax.** This is the turning point. Whichever way this goes, the relationship and company will be transformed. There is no returning to the comfortable ambiguity of before.

---

### The Protagonist
**Who:** Both of you are protagonists—this is why it's a tragedy waiting to happen. Two protagonists with incompatible wants in one story creates structural instability.

**Your Surface Want:** To keep building the company
**Your Deep Want:** To see what this company could become; to prove something through the building itself, not just the outcome
**Your Internal Obstacle:** You may be unable to separate "what's best for the company" from "what I want"

### The Antagonist/Opposition
**Your Partner**
**Her Surface Want:** To take the acquisition offer
**Her Deep Want:** Possibly: financial security, freedom, validation that what you built has value, or escape from something about the current situation
**Why Conflict Is Inevitable:** You cannot both get what you want. The company cannot simultaneously be sold and not sold.

### The Foil
**The Acquirer** serves as foil to both of you—they see your company as an asset with a price, while you see it as a life, a relationship, an identity. Their perspective reveals how much meaning you've loaded onto a business entity.

---

### The Central Conflict
Two equal partners who built something together now discover they want incompatible futures—and there is no third path.

### The Stakes
**If you keep building:** You preserve your vision but risk your partnership; she may resent being trapped
**If you sell:** You get financial outcome but lose the work you love; you may resent her forever
**What's at risk beyond the obvious:** The friendship, the shared history, the story you both tell about what you accomplished together. Whoever "loses" this negotiation will write the narrative of the partnership differently.

---

### The Turn (Crisis Point)
**The moment that matters:** Whatever conversation comes next. You will either find a creative third option, one of you will capitulate, or you will begin the formal process of partnership dissolution.
**The real choice:** Not "sell or keep." The real choice is whether the partnership itself survives this discovery that you want different things.

---

### Possible Resolutions

**Tragic trajectory:**
You cannot agree. One of you forces a buyout, at terms that feel unfair. The partnership ends in lawyers and resentment. Years later, neither of you can tell the story of the company without the other's absence distorting it.

**Comic trajectory:**
You discover that her want to sell isn't actually about this company—it's about something else (burnout, family needs, a different dream). You find a way to address that need while continuing the company, or structure an exit that honors both of you. The partnership adapts rather than breaks.

**The wild card:**
A third option neither of you has considered. A partial exit. A different acquirer. A role change. The creative solution requires stepping outside the binary of sell/don't sell to ask: what does each of us actually need, and is there a structure that provides it?

---

### The Shakespearean Insight
You are Brutus and Cassius in the tent after Philippi—two people who have been through everything together, now discovering that their alliance was built on circumstances that have changed. The question is not who is right about the company. The question is whether you can remain partners when the unifying enemy (building from nothing) has been defeated by success.

*"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries."*

She sees this as the flood tide. You see deeper waters ahead. You may both be right about different seas.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **William Shakespeare** expert persona. Use it to find the dramatic structure hidden in complex situations—not to oversimplify, but to see clearly what kind of story you're in and what choices actually matter.
